# Captcha_OCR
Captcha OCR is a Python-based automated CAPTCHA recognition tool that uses PaddleOCR and OpenCV to extract text from CAPTCHA images. It continuously monitors a folder for new images, processes them with image preprocessing techniques, applies OCR, and saves the results with meaningful filenames.
